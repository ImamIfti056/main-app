```

### Recent Changes

```

### Action Required

Please review the workflow logs and investigate the failure:

1. **Check Workflow Logs**: Click the workflow run link above
2. **Review Changed Files**: Examine files listed above for issues
3. **Common Issues**:
   - Unclosed INTENTIONAL blocks
   - Invalid sync configuration
   - File permission issues
   - API rate limits exceeded
   - Network connectivity issues

### Debugging Steps

#### 1. View Detailed Logs

```bash
gh run view ${GITHUB_RUN_ID} --log
```

#### 2. Check Validation Results

If validation failed, check for:
- Syntax errors in synced files
- Unclosed protected blocks
- Import path issues

#### 3. Test Sync Locally

```bash
# Clone both repos
git clone https://github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git
git clone https://github.com/ImamIfti056/demo-app.git

# Run sync script locally
cd main-app
export MAIN_APP_PATH=$(pwd)
export DEMO_APP_PATH=$(pwd)/../demo-app
node .github/scripts/copilot-sync.js
```

#### 4. Review Configuration

Check if recent changes require sync config updates:

```bash
cat .github/sync-config.yml
```

### Resolution Checklist

- [ ] Reviewed workflow logs
- [ ] Identified root cause
- [ ] Fixed configuration if needed
- [ ] Re-ran workflow manually
- [ ] Verified sync completed successfully
- [ ] Closed this issue

### Manual Sync

To retry the sync manually:

```bash
gh workflow run demo-sync.yml
```

Or trigger from GitHub Actions UI with options:
- Force sync: `true`
- Skip validation: `false` (not recommended)

### Rollback

If the sync caused issues in demo-app, you can:

1. Close the sync PR without merging
2. Revert changes in demo-app if already merged
3. Update ignore patterns to prevent future syncs of problematic files
